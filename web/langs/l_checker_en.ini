With this tool, you can check the character sheet written based on the documentation.<br/>
Only the XML file is needed, the rest is optional. The tool will check it's validity, and if it seems good, a pop-up window will show you how the sheet will appear ingame.<br/>
(The tool is under active developement, every bug notice/advice are welcome.)
